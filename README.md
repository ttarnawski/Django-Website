# Django-Website
This repository shows my Django project. It contains a website that role is to function as a open library, where users can lend their own books and borrow them from other users. It has currently 2 apps, one stands for book and book instance model and second one for user accounts. Project is still in progress.

- users can manually add a new object (book) to the database so then it is possible to add a new instance of this book
- users can manually add a new object (book instance) to the database (lend a book)
- users can choose a book instance object to change its field (borrow) so then it is not available to do by other users
- user authentication for above activities, in order to perform them, the user must sign up and log in
